# Visualization of [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

### Run:
Clone this repository using: ```git clone https://github.com/Flowyh/lorenz-attractor``` and run index.html.

### Usage:
- If you want to change any simulation variables (Lorenz equations constants, color offset, trail length or number of generated points) just change the values in corresponding text fields.

- You can change all Lorenz equation constants (sigma, rho, beta) on the fly, without restarting the simulation.

- To change max trail length na number of points you have to click Reset button afterwards or it gets buggy.

- You can enable/disable debug axes starting in (0, 0, 0) by clicking Debug button.

- Stop/start animation by clicking Stop/Start button.

- Use mouse scroll to zoom in/out, right mouse button to move the drawing, left mouse button to rotate.
